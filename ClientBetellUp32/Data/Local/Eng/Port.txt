1	"Welcome to the world of Mu.;We have been waiting for a hero like you to arrive and put a stop to the chaos brought on to the Mu realm by Kundun."
2	"Continue listening."
3	"However, journeys such as this are bound to be perilous.;If you wish, we can provide you with a simple tutorial. What do you say?"
4	"A tutorial?;I look forward to it!"
5	"Tutorials are for children. Turn down the offer."
6	"It won't take up too much of your time. I'll simply explain basic controls and hunting techniques.;Are you sure you don't want our help?"
7	"I have plenty of experience.;To each his own!"
8	"How can I turn him down...?;Alright, let's give it a try!"
9	"I'm glad we can help. We aren't difficult to find.;Simply look for and talk to the Shadow Phantom Soldier in any of the towns."
10	"I regret we can't be of any help to you.;Here, at least take this present. I hope, the next time we meet, a great warrior stands before my eyes.;Enjoy your time out there."
11	"I respect your decision to go on this journey.;Allow me to teach you a few simple but essential things you need to know before your adventure in MU begins."
12	"...This is Noria, the kingdom of Elves! So this is where my adventure begins.;How exhilarating!"
13	"...This is Lorencia, the kingdom of Dark Wizards and Dark Knights! So this is where my adventure begins.;Excellent! My adventure begins!"
14	"...This is Elveland, the kingdom of Summoners! So this is where my adventure begins.;How exhilarating!"
15	"It's nice to meet you.;May I ask who you are?"
16	"Alright! Let's get started with the tutorial."
17	"Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Olga. My fellow comrades from the Shadow Phantom Guardians and I serve Erin Gustiv, the queen of Noria."
18	"...Shadow Phantom?;Guardians of the queen?"
19	"What are the queen's guardians doing at a place like this?"
20	"The queen's orders are to help those warriors starting out on their journey so that they can at least defend themselves against the forces of Kundun."
21	"...I'm moved that the queen has made such orders."
22	"How will you help, exactly?"
23	"I will teach you basic hunting and controls through a simple tutorial.;It's not that difficult, and I'm sure you'll finish it in no time."
24	"Great! I'll finish this tutorial in no time!"
25	"Excellent! Let's get started with the tutorial."
26	"Let's start with something simple.;Close your quest window and either press C or click on the Character (C) button located on the bottom right of your screen to launch the Character Stats window."
27	"Did you launch the Character Stats window?;That window contains the character's name and level, the name of the current server, and character statuses."
28	"...There's nothing to it. But I would like to learn more...."
29	"Can you explain in more detail?"
30	"We have much to cover. Let's move on to the next step."
31	"I'll explain this in more detail. What else do you wish to know?"
32	"...I wish to learn about..."
33	"EXP Points and Leveling Up"
34	"Character and Server Selection"
35	"Points and Status"
36	"Gain EXP points to level up.;You can find out how many more points you need to reach the next level by checking your Character Stats window or the EXP bar located at the bottom of your screen.;The bar is divided into ten segments, and filling them up will elevate you to the next level."
37	"...Is that right? And then I'd like to learn about..."
38	"Character and Server Selection"
39	"Points and Status"
40	"You've explained enough. Let's continue with the tutorial."
41	"The Character Stats window will tell you the name of your character, the name of the current server, and your character's class. It's possible to connect to different channels within a single server using the same character.;There are four basic character classes: the Elf, the Dark Knight, the Dark Wizard, and the Summoner. Reach level 220 with any of these basic characters to unlock the Magic Gladiator, and level 250 to unlock the Dark Lord."
42	"Leveling up will earn you points. These points can be used to enhance your strength, agility, stamina, and energy and thereby affect your damage, defense, HP, and MP levels, respectively.;Carefully use these points, for how you develop your character will determine its combat characteristics and the types of weapons and skills it can use."
43	"Now, press the I button or click on the Inventory (I/V) button located on the bottom right to open your Inventory window."
44	"The Inventory window will display the items you have and the equipments you are wearing.;Click on an item to change its position or, if it's a consumable, right-click on it to use it. Did you get all that?"
45	"Of course I did."
46	"Quick, on to the next step!"
47	"You are full of zeal! Very well. Let's try adding an item to your inventory. Take the Zen I just gave you and purchase 5 apples from a merchant."
48	"Finally, a quest! You want me to buy 5 apples from a merchant?"
49	"Excellent! I will be back in a flash."
50	"Where can I find a merchant?"
51	"Apples can be purchased from potion merchants. In Lorencia, look for Potion Girl Amy, who is located across the bridge (128,85). In Elveland, look for Silvia, who is in the 1 o'clock direction from the center of the square (45,227). In Noria, look for Elf Lala, who is slightly to the north from the town's center (172,124)."
52	"...Finding a merchant is more difficult than I thought."
53	"How do I check coordinates?"
54	"The character's current coordinates are shown on the top left corner of the screen. Movement in the ¢Ø or ¢Ù direction changes the first number, and movement in the ¢Ö or ¢× direction the second."
55	"It's possible to find out the location of myself and others using coordinates? Amazing!"
56	"Loud and clear! Give me the next quest!"
57	"Go find the merchant in town and bring back 5 apples.;The NPC's name will be shown in light blue, and the point symbol will turn into a tooth symbol when you scroll over it with your mouse."
58	"Look at the right side of your screen. Do you see the apples you just bought? Adding a potion to the Inventory will automatically register it.;Press the Q button to use apples, potions, and other HP recovery items and the W button to use MP recovery items."
59	"Whoa! That's really convenient!"
60	"Continue the conversation."
61	"Since you now have potions, would you like to leave the safe zone and do some real hunting? Are you ready?"
62	"Great! I finally get the chance to show off what I can do."
63	"Excellent! What is the name of the monster you want me to hunt down?"
64	"Explain potions to me once more."
65	"Go beyond the walls of Noria and hunt down 3 Chain Scorpions.;If you find yourself in trouble, press the Q button to recover your HP. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
66	"Go beyond the walls of Lorencia and hunt down 3 Budge Dragons.;If you find yourself in trouble, press the Q button to recover your HP. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
67	"Go beyond the walls of Elveland and hunt down 3 Strange Rabbits.;If you find yourself in trouble, press the Q button to recover your HP. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
68	"I see you've successfully completed your first hunt! Did you find it difficult? Hunting monsters will earn you EXP points, drop items, and Zens.;You can pick up items dropped by defeated monsters using the mouse or automatically by pressing the space bar."
69	"Did you say the space bar?"
70	"That will surely make things easier. Do you have any other tips?"
71	"I already knew that. What's the next quest?"
72	"Also, if you find yourself far away from a town or cornered while on a hunt, the Town Portal Scroll can come in really handy. Are you familiar with using it?"
73	"...Town Portal Scroll?"
74	"What is this Town Portal Scroll?"
75	"Of course I know. What's the next quest?"
76	"Town Portal Scrolls can be purchased from potion merchants in towns. They are single-use items that will bring you back to the last town you visited.;Since we're on the subject, will you go and purchase a Town Portal Scroll from the merchant? It'll be easier to understand if you try it for yourself."
77	"...Hmm. I didn't know such thing existed."
78	"Very well. How many do I need to buy?"
79	"Go see the potion merchant again and buy just 1 Town Portal Scroll."
80	"You've done well. Let's see to one more thing before I ask you to face tougher monsters. Talk to me again and receive a damage and defense increase buff."
81	"A damage and defense increase buff? That sounds great!"
82	"How do I get it?"
83	"Close the Quest window and click on me again. After that, select 'Receive damage and defense increase buff.' This buff is available to anyone under level 220.;After receiving the buff, you will see an icon on the top left corner of the screen, a blue light effect surrounding the character, and have one hour of enhanced damage and defense."
84	"Excellent! It's time for the next quest. Since you are now familiar with hunting, let's get you to go after a tougher monster."
85	"Just say the word!"
86	"Excellent! What is the name of the monster you want me to hunt down?"
87	"Go beyond the walls of Noria and hunt down 30 Beetle Monsters. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
88	"Go beyond the walls of Lorencia and hunt down 30 Hounds. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
89	"Go beyond the walls of Elveland and hunt down 30 Polluted Butterflies. I'm sure this hunt is well within your abilities."
90	"I see you've now mastered hunting. When you hunt monsters, you can employ normal attacks by left-clicking or use skill attacks by right-clicking."
91	"...Skill attacks?"
92	"Where can I learn skills?"
93	"This is common knowledge."
94	"If you are an Agility Elf, whose priority is defense, you can equip a weapon and use its skills. If you are an Energy Elf, whose priority is wizardry, you can purchase orbs to learn skills."
95	"...How do I do it?"
96	"I want to be an Elf who focuses on defense!"
97	"I want to be an Elf who focuses on wizardry!"
98	"I don't want to decide right now. Just describe them for me."
99	"So you've decided to become an Agility Elf, a class for whom defense is crucial. Agility Elves are unique in that they employ splendid bow skills. Let me give you a weapon to use so that you can understand better."
100	"So you've decided to become an Energy Elf, a class for whom wizardry is crucial. Energy Elves are unique in that they employ a variety of summoning and magic spells. Let me give you an orb as a gift so that you can understand what I mean."
101	"Dark Knights are unique in that they are powerful swordsmen who rely on both weapons and orbs. Let me give you a weapon to use so that you can understand better."
102	"Dark Wizards are unique in that they are capable of mastering various magic spells from scrolls and parchments. Let me give you a scroll as a gift so that you can understand what I mean."
103	"Summoners are unique in that they are capable of mastering various magic spells from scrolls and parchments. Let me give you a scroll as a gift so that you can understand what I mean."
104	"The weapon I gave you is a crossbow. To equip it, load the crossbow item to the equipment slot in your Inventory. Go ahead and equip it."
105	"The orb I gave you will teach you the Summon Goblin skill. Right-click on the item to learn the skill. Go ahead and learn the skill."
106	"The weapon I gave you is a Double Axe. To equip it, load the Double Axe item to the equipment slot in your Inventory. Go ahead and equip it."
107	"The scroll I gave you will teach you the Fire Ball skill. Right-click on the item to learn the skill. Go ahead and learn the skill."
108	"If you are equipped with a weapon imbued with a skill, you can activate that skill by assigning it to the Skill window.;Can you see the numbered slots at the bottom center of the screen? Click on the icon outlined in green, to the right of the number five slot."
109	"After learning a skill from an orb, you can activate that skill by assigning it to the Skill window.;Can you see the numbered slots at the bottom center of the screen? Click on the icon outlined in green, to the right of the number five slot."
110	"After learning a skill from a scroll, you can activate that skill by assigning it to the Skill window.;Can you see the numbered slots at the bottom center of the screen? Click on the icon outlined in green, to the right of the number five slot."
111	"...The icon next to the number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 slots...."
112	"I got it!"
113	"You've done well. The Triple Shot skill should now be one of the skills you can use. Click on the icon.;Did the skill icon on the right switch to Triple Shot? When you're hunting monsters, simply right-click on the mouse to use the assigned skill."
114	"You've done well. The Summon Goblin skill should now be one of the skills you can use. Click on the icon.;Did the skill icon on the right switch to Summon Goblin? When you're hunting monsters, simply right-click on the mouse to use the assigned skill."

117	"I learned a skill!"
118	"Where can I learn more skills?"
119	"Elves can learn additional skills by going to Noria and purchasing orbs from Elf Lala (173,124) or weapons from Eo the Craftsman (195,123)."

123	"...I see it pays to know a lot of NPCs."
124	"I understand well. What's the next quest?"
125	"We're nearing the end of our tutorial. Now that you have a skill, it'll make sense for you to build more combat experience. Come back when you reach a certain level, and I will give you a Uniria as a reward."
126	"...Uniria?"
127	"What's a Uniria?"
128	"What level do I need to be?"
129	"Uniria is a mount item you can use out in the battle field. Equip it to the top left corner of your Inventory window for faster travel throughout the battle field."
130	"...That's fantastic!"
131	"What level do I need to be?"
132	"Come back once you've reached level 25.;I will then reward you with a Uniria as a gift."
133	"You've truly become a fine warrior. I'm sure the queen herself will be proud of you. Truth be told, she has arranged a few items for warriors such as you."
134	"...The queen is very thoughtful!"
135	"Continue listening."
136	"I will give you the queen's gifts if you pass a test to see if there's anything else you need to know and if you have the basic knowledge to travel throughout the MU realm. How about it?"
137	"Hmm...a test..."
138	"Excellent! Bring on the test!"
139	"I'd rather you give me the gifts without the test."
140	"The test is simple enough, and it won't matter if you don't get everything right. If you do, however, there's a small bonus gift.;Are you sure you don't want to take the test?"
141	"...A bonus gift if I answer all the questions right?"
142	"Excellent! Bring on the test!"
143	"I'll just take the queen's gifts without taking the test."
144	"Here's your first question.;How do you trade with a character that's in front of you?"
145	"...trade..."
146	"Press D and select Trade or type in '/trade' in the Chat window."
147	"Press D and select Trade or type in '/exchange' in the Chat window."
148	"Press D and select Trade or type in '/invite' in the Chat window."
149	"That is correct! Pressing D will give you access to various commands, including Trade, Party, Buy, and Follow. Use these commands well."
150	"Ah, you've answered incorrectly. To trade, press D and select Trade or face the character and type in '/trade' in the Chat window. Let's skip to the next question."
151	"When you want to form a party with a character, face that character and enter '/party' in the Chat window. What do you do if you don't want to receive party requests?"

160	"From the Chat window, use the Shift button."
161	"From the Chat window, use the Ctrl button."
162	"From the Chat window, use the Tab button."
163	"That is correct! When you want to talk to a friend and you know his or her ID, or if you want to pass on private messages, send whispers by using Tab from the Chat window."
164	"Ah, you've answered incorrectly. When you want to talk to a friend and you know his or her ID, or if you want to pass on private messages, send whispers by using Tab from the Chat window. Let's skip to the next question."
165	"You'll need to regularly repair your equipments since their durability will diminish as you hunt monsters. When you reach a certain level, you will be able to repair your equipments directly from the Inventory window. What level is that?"
166	"Too easy! To repair equipment without the help of an NPC, I need to be at..."
167	"Level 30"
168	"Level 50"
169	"Level 75"
170	"That is correct! You can have your equipment repaired by Hanzo the Blacksmith (117,140) in Lorencia, Rhea (30, 235) in Elveland, or Eo the Craftsman (194, 123) in Noria. Solicit their services often."
171	"Ah, you've answered incorrectly.; You'll be able to repair your equipment with ease by using the Repair button from the Inventory window once you reach level 50. However, this is more costly than repairing through an NPC.;Let's move on to the next question."
172	"The higher the level, the more distance you get to travel. Using the M button, however, it's possible to travel to distant areas in a flash. What is the minimum level you need to be and the amount of Zen you need in order to enter the Dungeon?"
173	"Hmm...First, press M and then..."
174	"Level 10 and 2,000 Zens"
175	"Level 30 and 3000 Zens"
176	"Level 50 and 4000 Zens"
177	"That is correct! In the MU world, you can use the M button to travel with ease, provided that your level is high enough and you have enough money for the destination.;Discovering areas that's right for your level, and hunting there, can also be very fun."
178	"Ah, you've answered incorrectly. Use M to find out and travel to accessible areas with ease. Discovering areas that are right for your level, and hunting there, can also be very fun.;On to the next question."
179	"In MU, it's possible to combine different items to create new ones. In fact, trying out different combinations of items adds a whole new dimension to MU.;Whom should you seek out in order to combine items?"
180	"The answer is obvious!"
181	"The Goblin NPC in Noria."
182	"The Seed Master NPC in Elveland."
183	"The Trainer NPC in Lorencia."
184	"That is correct! With the help of NPCs in the towns, you can not only combine items, but also enhance your armor by adding jewels to it and much more. Make sure to visit them all."
185	"Ah, you've answered incorrectly. Take the items, ingredients, and the money you need for combining to the Goblin in Noria to create a new item. Make sure to try it at least once. Let's skip to the next question."
186	"Congratulations. You've completed the tutorial. Take this Ring of Hero and this Ring of Warrior. They are gifts to you from the queen."
187	"...Finally, the tutorial's finished!"
188	"Ring of Hero? Ring of Warrior? What are they?"
189	"Thank you!"
190	"Ah, I'll have to go far back in time to explain that.;Runedil, the former queen of Elves, was saddened by the loss of all the new warriors of the MU empire, who gave up their lives to constant warring."
191	"...."
192	"Continue listening."
193	"So she imbued rings with the power of the Elves and gave them to warriors in honor of Muren's practice of handing out warriors' rings bearing the emperor's crest."
194	"...."
195	"Continue listening."
196	"That custom all but disappeared when peace finally came. However, Kundun and the chaos he brought motivated Erin Gustiv, the reigning queen of the Elves, to reinstate it."
197	"Ah. So that's what happened...."
198	"Continue listening."
199	"When a warrior who possesses them becomes a consummate expert in his or her art, these rings transform into unique items that will help their master attain greater heights."
200	"Oh! That will surely come in handy!"
201	"Take the rings."
202	"You'll be able to use the Ring of Hero at level 40 and the Ring of Warrior at level 80. Dropping the rings will break their seal and transform them into items.;Next time we meet, I sincerely hope to see a mightier warrior before me. Go now and build your experience and strength and free this world from Kundun's grasp!;(You've completed the tutorial.)"

1004	"Leave Gens Duprian."
1005	"Accept a gens quest."
1006	"Gens Duprian is a guild of the greatest heroes in Arca and at its heart is the Duprian clan, the mightiest noble bloodline in MU. We are led by Duprian Winston, a knight who knows no equal in the whole of the MU empire."
1007	"Go back."
1008	"Gens dispute¡¦? Gens Vanert¡¯s rebellion is more like it. The gens dispute started because of the greed of Vanert Reicht, the commanding knight of Gens Vanert. Exactly five years ago, a band of heroes who were searching in La Cleon for a stone with the power to seal away Kundun were slaughtered. At the time, we believed it was the work of Selupan, a giant spider and the ruler of La Cleon, but soon learned that it was actually Gens Vanert. It is the duty of our proud Gens Duprian champions to retaliate and fight."
1009	"Oh! You wish to become a member of Gens Duprian? Share our virtues of honor and respect, and help in the fight to crush the greed of Gens Vanert and find the stone that will seal away Kundun."
1010	"Yes. I wish to join."
1011	"No. I will give it more thought."
1012	"If you leave the gens, your contribution will be reset.;Do you still wish to leave?"
1013	"Yes. I wish to leave."
1014	"Congratulations on becoming a member of Gens Duprian.  Much will be asked of you in the name of our cause. Come see me whenever you require assistance concerning the gens."

1017	"You have to be at least level 50 in order to join the gens."

1054	"Leave Gens Vanert."
1055	"Accept a gens quest."
1056	"Gens Vanert is a noble family led by Vanert Reicht, the greatest socialite in the whole of the MU empire. The master strives around the clock to put a stop to Duprian Winston and his dream of absolute rule over the empire."
1057	"Vanert Reicht may have conceded leadership of Noble Alliance Arca to Duprian Winston at the alliance's inception, but the master has always remained committed to eliminating the foul minions of Kundun and to the revival of the MU empire. Everyone knows about Duprian Winston's desires to subjugate the empire under his absolute rule. It's imperative that heroes like you help Vanert Reicht seal away Kundun and restore peace to the MU empire."
1058	"Hmm... you are a wise warrior. Go now and achieve great things in the name Gens Vanert, knowing that I will always be here to assist you."
1059	"Congratulations on becoming a member of Gens Vanert. Much will be asked of you in the name of our cause. Come see me whenever you require assistance concerning the gens."
1060	"You cannot join a gens if you are a member of the guild alliance. Leave the guild alliance and try joining the gens again."
1061	"Congratulations. You have contributed more to the cause of the gens than any other member. Duprian Winston rewards your accomplishments. I hope to see even greater achievements from you next month."
1062	"Oh! Thanks to your bravery, we were able to crush those good-for-nothing Duprians once again. This is a reward bestowed to you by Vanert Reicht himself for your contributions in battle. I hope to see you in action once again next month."
1063	"Gens Ranking Reward"

2001	"Would you like to visit Chaos Castle, the arena of the gods? There is no better place to prove your strength. Why don't you listen to what I have to say and then decide? (Basic character: Level 15-49, Advanced character: Level 15-29)"
2002	"Chaos Castle..."
2003	"Very well. Tell me more."
2004	"I know it well. I hear you need an item to participate in the event...."
2005	"You're well-informed. I will give you the item you need to access Chaos Castle. When you have time, come see me for an easy quest."
2006	"A wise decision. Chaos Castle is a battle field created by Lugard, the god of the heaven world, and Secrarium, the god of the underworld, for the balance of good and evil in this world. However, travelers started going to Chaos Castle and fighting on the side of Lugard, tipping the balance in disfavor of Secrarium."
2007	"......."
2008	"To restore balance to the battle event, Secrarium made Lugard an offer and suggested implementation of a new rule. This rule was for everyone participating in the event to wear guardsman's armor. Lugard, believing the offer to be fair, accepted."
2009	"I see."
2010	"Unfortunately, Secrarium was betting that darkness in the hearts of the travelers would ultimately lead to hostility and discord among them. Lugard was also aware of the travelers' dark side, but his trust in them didn't waver. Ultimately, the travelers did begin to feud with one another like the dark god had anticipated, and Chaos Castle became ever more... chaotic."
2011	"I guess Lugard was tricked by Secrarium. How do I participate?"
2012	"It's very easy to enter Chaos Castle. Simply right-click on your Armor of Guardsman at the appropriate times (12:00am, 14:00pm, 16:00pm, 18:00pm, 20:00pm, and 22:00pm) to enter. Players in designated locations, such as a PC cafe, will have more opportunities to enter."
2013	"It really is easy to enter. What does the event involve, exactly?"
2014	"You will stand by for about a minute before actually entering. The event starts once this standby time passes. Once it does start, travelers and corrupt guardsmen will fight each other to the death in a no-holds-barred melee. "
2015	"Is there anything I need to be cautious of?"
2016	"It doesn't matter with the travelers, but you have to be careful when you kill a corrupt guardsman. Corrupt guardsmen will explode and may even push you off the arena. If this happens, you will be disqualified."
2017	"It all makes sense now. "
2018	"If you want to find out when you can enter, simply move your mouse over the Armor of Guardsman. If you want to enter, simply right-click on the armor at a designated time. Come see me when you have time, and I will give you a quest that will earn you the item needed to enter the event."
2019	"You are back sooner than I thought. I will give you a quest that will earn you the item you need to enter the event. Will you accept this quest? (Basic character: Level 15-49, Advanced character: Level 15-29)"
2020	"By a 'simple quest', do you mean killing monsters?"
2021	"Very well. Give me the quest."
2022	"I don't have the time right now. I'll do it next time."
2023	"That's unfortunate. Please come back if you change your mind. (The quest has been cancelled.)"
2024	"Very well. It appears Larvae are causing quite a headache for novice travelers to the Dungeon these days. If you defeat 40 Larvae, I will offer you a choice of two rewards from 30 Healing Potions, 30 Mana Potions, and 4 Small SD Potions. When you claim you rewards, make sure you have at least 20 empty slots in your Inventory. Remember that."

3002	"Blood Castle..."
3003	"Very well. Tell me more."
3004	"I know it well. I hear you need a special item to go there...."
3005	"You're well-informed. In order to penetrate the barrier surrounding Blood Castle, you will need an Invisibility Cloak. If you pass a simple test of mine, I will provide you with an Invisibility Cloak before you head to Blood Castle. When you have time, come see me for an easy quest."
3006	"I will tell you then. Devildom's royal guards, who were summoned when Kundun succumbed to Secrarium, posed a great threat to the heaven world. To protect their base, the Twelve Saints formed a barrier around Blood Castle. "
3007	"......."
3008	"Kundun, however, must've anticipated such a move. He hid beyond the range of the barrier and eliminated the Twelve Saints as soon as the barrier was formed. Luckily, Archangel evaded that peril and sacrificed himself for the barrier. "
3009	"......."
3010	"Kundun's Royal Guards, however, continue to attack the barrier, and are weakening it. We need Archangel's weapon in order to prevent this weakening of the barrier, and that's why we are now seeking the help of travelers."
3011	"I see. How do I enter?"
3012	"It's very easy to enter Blood Castle. The battle event takes place every two hours from 12:30am and on. To enter, take an Invisibility Cloak that's right for your level to the Messenger of Archangel in Devias, five minutes before a Blood Castle event commences and ask to join. The Messenger of Archangel will then send you to the castle."
3013	"It really is easy to enter. What does the event involve, exactly?"
3014	"You will stand by for about a minute before actually entering. You'll enter Blood Castle after this standby time has elapsed. Once inside Blood Castle, you can buy some time by defeating 40 monsters summoned by a necromancer named Red Skull."
3015	"......."
3016	"Go past the castle gate and defeat two Red Skulls who have hidden the Absolute Weapon. This will buy you some more time and reveal a casket containing the weapon. Destroy the casket, defeat more monsters, and return the Absolute Weapon to Archangel to successfully complete the Blood Castle quest."
3017	"I understand."
3018	"To find out when you can enter, simply press the F1 key. If you want to enter, take an Invisibility Cloak that's right for your level to the Messenger of Archangel before the scheduled start time.

3021	"Very well. Give me the quest."

3023	"That's unfortunate. Please come back if you change your mind. (The quest has been cancelled.)"
3024	"Very well. It appears Hell Hounds are causing quite a headache for novice travelers to the Dungeon these days. Hunt down 40 Hell Hounds, and I'll give you an Invisibility Cloak + 1 as a reward. At your current level, it'll be too dangerous for you to hunt the monsters alone. It'll be better if you hunt in a party."
3025	"In Blood Castle, you'll be fighting against time. Good armor and weapons will, of course, help you complete your quest. But more than anything else, solidarity of your party is what will count there. Will you accept Archangel's quest? (Basic character: Level 15-80, Advanced character: Level 10-60)"
3026	"......"
3027	"Of course. I gladly accept Archangel's quest."
3028	"I neither have the skills nor the warriors I need to take on this quest. Give me more time."
3029	"That's unfortunate. Come see me again when you find the right warriors to fight at your side. (The quest has been cancelled.)"

5002	"Illusion Temple..."
5003	"Very well. Tell me more."
5004	"I already knew that."
5005	"You're well-informed. I'm in charge of distributing items that are necessary to enter Illusion Temple. When you have time, come see me for an easy quest that will earn you a ticket in."
5006	"Illusion Spells, the foundation of Illusion Sorcery, was discovered by an Archaeologist named Mirage. Mirage found the spells' power to be too dangerous and sealed it. His partner Lev, however, stole the spells to brainwash people and establish Illusion Sorcery. Illusion Sorcery gradually grew larger and brought chaos to the continent."
5007	"......."
5008	"Grand Wizard Etramu vowed to destroy Illusion Sorcery and formed an army to subjugate its followers. Under Etramu's command, the alliance engaged the followers of Illusion Sorcery with formidable force. Despite having been driven all the way back to Illusion Temple, the followers continued to resist. As battle raged on, Lev disappeared and left the followers of Illusion Sorcery in confusion. Ultimately, they all met their death at the hands of the alliance on the temple grounds."
5009	"......."
5010	"Due to Lev's illusion spells, however, the souls of the dead followers remained in this world to defend the temple. These souls believed Lev's return would allow them to reclaim their bodies and continued to safeguard the temple. Today, the temple is guarded by the alliance in case Lev does actually return and Illusion Sorcery uses ancient relics to lure in unsuspecting travelers to their cause."
5011	"I see. How do I enter?"
5012	"It's very easy to enter Illusion Temple. It can be entered every four hours from 01:00 a.m. and on: 01:00 a.m., 05:00 a.m., 09:00 a.m., 01:00 p.m., 05:00 p.m., and 09:00 p.m. To enter, take a Scroll of Blood that's right for your level to Mirage in Elveland five minutes before an Illusion Temple event commences and ask to join. Mirage will then send you to the temple. "
5013	"It really is easy to enter. What does the event involve, exactly?"
5014	"Upon entering, you'll need to wait for other players to enter. The players will then be divided into two teams: Alliance Camp and Illusion Sorcery Camp. The camp that brings over more relics to their own side wins. "
5015	"Is there anything I should be aware of about Illusion Temple?"
5016	"You'll not be able to use certain skills like Teleport or Telekinesis while holding on to a relic. On the other hand, there are special skills that can only be used in Illusion Temple. Using these skills to your advantage will make it easier for your camp to win."
5017	"It all makes sense now. "
5018	"To find out when you can enter, press the F1 key. Then, take a Scroll of Blood that's right for your level to Mirage in Elveland five minutes before the entry time you've chosen. You'll then be sent to Illusion Temple. Come see me when you have time, and I'll give you a quest that will earn you the item needed to enter Illusion Temple."
5019	"You are back sooner than I thought. I have a simple quest that will earn you a Scroll of Blood, which will grant you access to Illusion Temple. Will you accept? (All characters: Level 220-270)"

5023	"That's unfortunate. Please come back if you change your mind. (The quest has been cancelled.)"
5024	"The increasing number of Bloody Wolves in Tarkan is becoming worrisome. Hunt down 50 Bloody Wolves, and I'll give you a Scroll of Blood + 1 as a reward."
5025	"You can find both wealth and fame at Illusion Temple. If you take the temple challenge, you might acquire something essential for your training. Would you like to take the challenge? (All characters: Level 220-270)"
5026	"......"

5030	"Try your hand at Illusion Temple Level 1. Win and I'll give you 1 Jewel of Soul as a reward. However, this applies only to Illusion Temple Level 1."
5031	"Have you ever heard of Illusion Temple and the ancient relics hidden there? It's a place where travelers can find both wealth and fame. Why don't you listen to what I have to say and then decide? (All characters: Level 271-320)"
5032	"Illusion Temple..."
5033	"Very well. Tell me more."
5034	"I already knew that."
5035	"You're well-informed. I'm in charge of distributing items that are necessary to enter Illusion Temple. When you have time, come see me for an easy quest that will earn you a ticket in."
5036	"Illusion Spells, the foundation of Illusion Sorcery, was discovered by an Archaeologist named Mirage. Mirage found the spells' power to be too dangerous and sealed it. His partner Lev, however, stole the spells to brainwash people and establish Illusion Sorcery. Illusion Sorcery gradually grew larger and brought chaos to the continent."
5037	"......."
5038	"Grand Wizard Etramu vowed to destroy Illusion Sorcery and formed an army to subjugate its followers. Under Etramu's command, the alliance engaged the followers of Illusion Sorcery with formidable force. Despite having been driven all the way back to Illusion Temple, the followers continued to resist. As battle raged on, Lev disappeared and left the followers of Illusion Sorcery in confusion. Ultimately, they all met their death at the hands of the alliance on the temple grounds."
5039	"......."
5040	"Due to Lev's illusion spells, however, the souls of the dead followers remained in this world to defend the temple. These souls believed Lev's return would allow them to reclaim their bodies and continued to safeguard the temple. Today, the temple is guarded by the alliance in case Lev does actually return and Illusion Sorcery uses ancient relics to lure in unsuspecting travelers to their cause."
5041	"I see. How do I enter?"
5042	"It's very easy to enter Illusion Temple. It can be entered every four hours from 01:00 a.m. and on: 01:00 a.m., 05:00 a.m., 09:00 a.m., 01:00 p.m., 05:00 p.m., and 09:00 p.m. To enter, take a Scroll of Blood that's right for your level to Mirage in Elveland five minutes before an Illusion Temple event commences and ask to join. Mirage will then send you to the temple. "
5043	"It really is easy to enter. What does the event involve, exactly?"
5044	"Upon entering, you'll need to wait for other players to enter. The players will then be divided into two teams: Alliance Camp and Illusion Sorcery Camp. The camp that brings over more relics to their own side wins. "
5045	"Is there anything I should be aware of about Illusion Temple?"
5046	"You'll not be able to use certain skills like Teleport or Telekinesis while holding on to a relic. On the other hand, there are special skills that can only be used in Illusion Temple. Using these skills to your advantage will make it easier for your camp to win."
5047	"It all makes sense now. "
5048	"To find out when you can enter, press the F1 key. Then, take a Scroll of Blood that's right for your level to Mirage in Elveland five minutes before the entry time you've chosen. You'll then be sent to Illusion Temple. Come see me when you have time, and I'll give you a quest that will earn you the item needed to enter Illusion Temple."
5049	"You are back sooner than I thought. I have a simple quest that will earn you a Scroll of Blood, which will grant you access to Illusion Temple. Will you accept? (All characters: Level 271-320)"
5050	"By a 'simple quest', do you mean killing monsters?"

You can try to be the last one standing in Chaos Castle, or work with your comrades to battle through Blood Castle, Devil Square, or Illusion Temple. Travelers regard such feats as some of the worthiest accomplishments one can achieve."
6002	"So it's not just about equipment or level."
6003	"That's right. You do need good equipment and a high level to test your mettle against other travelers, yes. But just that isn't enough for you to become a hero of MU.

20087	"¡¦¡¦ Something pestering seems to happen¡¦¡¦"
20088	"Not at all. It's only natural to work for the clan. (Accept)"
20089	"You know well enough. I don't want to talk about it. (Refuse)"
